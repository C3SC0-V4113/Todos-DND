- [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) - React Redux

### What I learned

Im proud of my new knowledge in drag and drop packages, and how to integrate them, im also proud of how i implement redux and react-router-dom together, using actions, loaders, but also async thunks, also im proud of how ive connected the api and the error management I think i would do different the error management, sometimes i dont return anything beside the error message, also the authentication process is sometimes kinda messy

### Continued development

I want to learn new and improved ways to integrate redux and react-router together, particularly in the authentication.

## Acknowledgments

- I got some routing and component ideas from a friend named Adilson Vasquez. I worked with him in the past, and he taught me a lot of things, such as organizing my API folder and using custom Hooks for each form.
